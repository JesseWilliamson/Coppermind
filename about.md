Coppermind is *a one-column minimal responsive Jekyll blog theme*.

## Why another Jekyll theme?

The modern web is bloated and disorganised. Pages load slowly and require large, resource-hungry web browsers to acess them. The machines and networks of years ago would be entirely adequate today if the programs they run were better optimised. This project seeks to provide a simple, low-dependency framework for creation of static sites.

## Setup

This project:

- Is built as a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Was created as a fork of [Monophase](https://github.com/whk-io/monophase) with additional features, fixes, and customisations

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/zivhub/Coppermind/issues/new).

Thanks for reading!
